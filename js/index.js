	it differs from icono.css because it's size is always the same
	instead of needing to wrap it inside a div
	
	- box does not depend on margins
	- size should be responsive to the font-size
	- colored icons (for programming languages and flags)
	
	
	reference:
	- cssicon.space
	- git.io/icono
	- fontawesome.io/icons
	- useiconic.com/icons/
	
	problems:
	- pixalization and spaces between pixels due to fractions
